Go library to interact with [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/en)'s Hosting API and manage Virtual Machines, Disks, IPs and Vlans. Currently working on implementing the driver for the [XMLRPC API](https://doc.rpc.gandi.net/overview.html) while the development of the new API, [V5](https://docs.gandi.net/en/cloud/index.html), finishes. The API this library provides will not change once the driver for V5 is implemented.
