# Gandi-Go Hosting library

![build-badge](https://action-badges.now.sh/PabloPie/Gandi-Go) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/PabloPie/Gandi-Go/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/PabloPie/Gandi-Go)

Go library to interact with [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/en)'s Hosting API and manage Virtual Machines, Disks, IPs and Vlans. Currently working on implementing the driver for the [XMLRPC API](https://doc.rpc.gandi.net/overview.html) while the development of the new API, [V5](https://docs.gandi.net/en/cloud/index.html), finishes. The API this library provides will not change once the driver for V5 is implemented.
